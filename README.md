For this project we were tasked with creating a personal magic mirror. In thinking of the creation of the design i wanted to make it as easy to read and as simple as possible to make sure the user has no issues with understanding anything as well as having too many things to impair the view of themseleves. The usability of this interface is very easy becaise everything is already there for you and all you would have to do is click on the sections that you would want to see more information about and then it would pop up. The feedback from the mirror is having personal information pop up as well as a clock that is continuously ticking so you know that all the information is as fresh as possible. Throughout the design of the mirror i kept the same font, color schemes on text, icons, backgrounds and i made sure that everything was balanced both horizontally and vertically using the grid method. The design of my mirror is made for minimalists because they want to have as little information while still having all the information. I took the time to make sure that the color schemes that were used were not too contrasting and that they complemented each other well while still having contrast to know what is what.
